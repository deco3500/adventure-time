# Introduction
The project team Adventure Time is working on during Semester 2 2016 is “Bargain Hunter”, which is a website application made for students that want to save money by finding deals in their local area. Bargain Hunter allows users to set filters based on their particular interests and location. High quality posts attract more views/up-votes and can earn points which are used to earn a higher ranking within the Bargain Hunter community. With these features Bargain Hunter addresses the social journalism dilemma that news is distributed through multiple sources. 

# Concept
The idea behind the Bargain Hunter project is to acquire data from online social media, retailer websites, and user submitted information to direct them to one single news source. The data we are concerning ourselves with is “Bargains” or discounts. The purpose of this is to create a single source which people can turn to in order to find this information, rather than scanning several sources themselves, saving them time as well as money.

The concept is aimed mainly at students, aged from around 17-25. This target audience was chosen based on assumptions that the majority of students in this age category earn their own money (are not given free money from parents) and are on a relatively tight budget, consequently giving them the greatest benefit from using the application. Also, students are generally up to date with technology, and use social media often.

There are several current offerings which showcase discounts and bargains in Australia such as allthedeals.com.au, or ozbargain.com.au. However these sites do not crawl social media, or websites for information. As well as displaying user submitted deals, crawling multiple sources will allow Bargain Hunter to  showcase discounts as soon as they are made visible online.  Also, bargain hunter is unique because it tracks the user’s location and shows discounts in the area through the use of a map.

# Decision Making
Decisions for this project will be made by discussing the pro’s and con’s of concepts as a group. We are hoping this method should lead to a naturally resolved discussion where everyone agrees on the final decision and has had their fair share of input. However, in the case where the discussion does not naturally resolve, we will put the decision to a vote.

# Performance
Team Adventure-Time will strive to achieve the best possible grade for the course. In the event of a poor/unsatisfactory grade the team will evaluate the processes undertaken for the assessment piece and revise a new strategy for obtaining the optimal grade for the next assessment.

Should the poor/unsatisfactory grade be obtained due to a member(s) of the team, the remaining members will seek advice from the tutors/lecturer to resolve the situation. 

# Conflict Resolution
####Reasons for conflict:
* A team member is not contributing to the project.
* A team member fails to attend team meetings.
* Failed communication within the team.

#### Steps for resolution:
* If a team member is not doing their part for the team, the team will meet to discuss the issue, and find the reason for the member not contributing to the project. 
    * If the problem is beyond the team members control, then the task can be reassigned to another team member
    * If the member’s reason is not legitimate, they will be addressed and the problem will be discussed
    * If the problem is not solved, the team will consult a tutor, and if the problem persists, the team will contact the course coordinator 	

* If a team member fails to attend team meetings without letting the group know first, they will firstly be informed that they missed a meeting, and they will be caught up on the information they missed.
    * If this happens frequently, the team member will be seen as not contributing to the project. A team meeting will be held and the team will find a solution. All members must be a part of this meeting.
    * If the problem still cannot be resolved, the team will consult the tutor, and if the problem persists the course coordinator will be contacted. 

* If there is a problem with communication between the team, or a specific member is failing to communicate, attempts will be made to restore the communication as soon as possible. These attempts will be made through:
    * Facebook Group
    * Emailing/texting/calling the team member/s directly
    * Discussion during the weekly face-to-face meeting.
    * If this fails, the team member/s will be considered as not contributing to the project. A meeting will be held and the team will find a solution to the problem. All members must attend this meeting.
    * If the conflict persists, a tutor or the course coordinator will be contacted.

# Communications
Majority of group meetings will take place during the workshop sessions, to collaborate in person. If needed, the team will meet at at a group study room on campus at a time agreed on by the group. The team will communicate via Facebook for quick comments and discussions, but utilize the issues system on GitHub, and the comments feature on Google Drive for topics that are specific to a particular section or will contain information that we would like to keep.

Application files will be stored on GitHub, conforming to UQ’s Git guidelines of use. Documents and other relevant files will be stored in the shared Google Drive folder we have created. We will all strive to keep our work as updated as possible for the benefit of the other group members, however we must also be wary not to break the Git Repo.

Prepare Survey
Goal:
Understand users of similar apps in the market and what design would attract users to use our application

Tasks:
Create a survey asking users of similar apps:
 Why they use the application
What makes them come back to the application they use
Why do they prefer certain apps over others
What would the user change about the application they use
The survey will require specific questions so we are provided with useable feedback to create our interface design.

Prototype #1
User testing and evaluation
Goal:
Get feedback on layout of application

Tasks:
Each team member should gather at least 1 friend and ask them if they are able to film a feedback session for our university project

Present the friend with the paper prototype and ask them to complete a task. (each member will be given one aspect to test, either through horizontal prototyping or vertical prototyping)

Film the testing session. Ask the friend to speak how they feel about completing certain tasks and talk through what they’re doing.

Does user know what the app is
Does user understand how app works
Is the app hard to navigate for user
Is the app appealing (visually and functionality)
Would the user use app again
Why is this app better/worse than existing apps in the market
What would the user change,etc)

Filming/recording the demonstration will allow the team to grasp where users are having trouble with the application and allow the team to alter the interface design where need be.
